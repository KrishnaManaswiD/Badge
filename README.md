# Badge
A congratulatory gift for my firends who completed their PhDs with me.   
Front: an engraved name badge with a built in micro-controller and a ruler to measure their tiny egos with.  
Back: a pictorial representation of our theses and a battery holder with a magnetic piece.

The gerber files can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/KrishnaManaswiD/Badge/blob/main/Gerber_PCB_2020-01-05%2022_20_36.zip)  

I used [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) to get the boards manufactured. This was the first time that I tried panelising the boards and I am pleased with the resutls.
The black silk screen looks nice.  

The board was designed using [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/). You can have a look at the schematic [here](https://github.com/KrishnaManaswiD/Badge/blob/main/docs/Schematic_2020-08-21.pdf).  

I sourced all the components except the magnetic badge pieces from [LCSC](https://lcsc.com/). Click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/KrishnaManaswiD/Badge/blob/main/bom/ibom.html) for an interactive BOM. You can also download a csv version from [here](https://github.com/KrishnaManaswiD/Badge/blob/main/bom/BOM.csv).
